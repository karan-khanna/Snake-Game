# Snake-Game
A simple snake game in C++ 
This game is the new version of the classic Snake Game we all loved but with greater difficulties and challenges.

Here, you get an interactive menu to choose your own level or the stage for gameplay ,the speed of your snake and even the color of your snake.

The gameplay features a snake which needs to be guided using controls to feed it with apples and as it eats more apples , it grows in length , thereby making it difficult to move without colliding.The more apples the snake eats, the higher is the score.
The game ends if the snake collides with itself or with the walls in the level.
